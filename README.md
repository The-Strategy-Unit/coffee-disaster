# Coffee disaster :coffee:💥

In the data science team we love coffee. We also seem to love accidentally pouring it all over our keyboards.



This dashboard tracls the number of days since our last coffee disaster.

This sidequest project is a useful place to test out GitHub actions, play with CSS styling, learn about accessibility or demo best practice GitHub features.
